  Design fictions: Presented in the first round to elicit qualitative insights and familiarize participants with the possibilities of conversational agents. 
  Pseudo-dialogue: Used in the second round, where participants responded to direct quotes from their peers to refine their opinions. 
  Requirement statements: Synthesized from previous rounds and validated in the final round using binary agree/disagree responses. 
  
  Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic coding (deductive and inductive) with the assistance of NVIVO software.",
